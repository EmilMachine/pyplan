A small test project to help scheduling acting practice. 

The problem: Schedule simultanius acting practice when N people is asigned to M scenes (and most people are assigned to multiple scenes).

In particular find subsets of the M scenes that can practice at the same time (so there is no overlap between people). 

The end goal is a web based interfaced. 
The plan is:

1. Python backend.
2. Web based frontend (javascript?)
3. ???
4. Profit :)

where ??? likely is the fun part of reiterating a 1000 times, and hopefully get somebody to test it out.
